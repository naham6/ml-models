# Machine Learning Models Collection

This repository contains a collection of machine learning experiments, data analysis exercises, and predictive models implemented in Python. It serves as a practical portfolio demonstrating the implementation and evaluation of various supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms using `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.

## 📁 Repository Contents

### Classification & Predictive Modeling
* **`Predicting_Cancer level.ipynb` (New)**: A comprehensive supervised learning workflow predicting cancer risk levels. Includes extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Seaborn pairplots, data preprocessing, and model evaluation (achieving ~89% accuracy using a Decision Tree Classifier with k-fold cross-validation).
* **`logistic and dt.ipynb`**: Implementations of Logistic Regression and Decision Tree classifiers for binary/multiclass classification tasks.
* **`DT_and_RF.ipynb`**: A comparative look at single Decision Trees versus ensemble methods using Random Forests.
* **`knn and svc.ipynb`**: Implementation of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Classifiers (SVC).
* **`LOGISTIC_ON_ADVERTISING.ipynb`: A binary classification model using Logistic Regression to predict whether a user will click on an advertisement based on some features.
### Regression
* **`Linear regression on ecom.ipynb`**: Linear regression applied to the `Ecommerce Customers` dataset to analyze and predict customer spending behavior.
* **`lin.ipynb`**: Foundational linear regression model analyzing the `USA_Housing.csv` dataset to predict housing prices.

### Unsupervised Learning
* **`kmean_example.ipynb`**: Demonstrations of the K-Means clustering algorithm for identifying patterns in unlabeled datasets.
